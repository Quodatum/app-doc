 : Measures the time needed to evaluate <code>$expr</code> and sends it to standard error or, if the GUI is used, to the Info View.
 : If <code>$cache</code> is set to <code>true()</code> , the result will be temporarily cached. This way, a potential iterative execution of the expression (which often yields different memory usage) is blocked.
 : A third, optional argument <code>$label</code> may be specified to tag the profiling result.
 : The function is <i>non-deterministic</i> : evaluation order will be preserved by the compiler.

 : Prints a list of all current local and global variable assignments to standard error or, if the GUI is used, to the Info View.
 : As every query is optimized before being evaluated, not all of the original variables may be visible in the output. Moreover, many variables of function calls will disappear because functions are inlined. Function inlining can be turned off by setting the <a href="http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Options#INLINELIMIT">INLINELIMIT</a> option to <code>0</code> .

 : Returns the number of milliseconds passed since 1970/01/01 UTC. The granularity of the value depends on the underlying operating system and may be larger. For example, many operating systems measure time in units of tens of milliseconds.
 : In contrast to <code>fn:current-time()</code> , the function is <i>non-deterministic</i> , as it returns different values every time it is called. Its evaluation order will be preserved by the compiler.

 : Swallows all items of the specified <code>$value</code> and returns an empty sequence. This function is helpful if some code needs to be evaluated and if the actual result is irrelevant.
