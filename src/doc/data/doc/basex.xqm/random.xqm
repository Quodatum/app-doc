 : This <a href="http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Module_Library">XQuery Module</a> contains functions for computing random values. All functions except for <a href="#random:seeded-double">random:seeded-double</a> and <a href="#random:seeded-integer">random:seeded-integer</a> are non-deterministic, i.â€¯e., they return different values for each call.
